# Versatile Bubble Sort: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Project Overview
"Versatile Bubble Sort" is a C++ project designed to test the efficiency and reliability of bubble sort implementations across various data types and container types. This comprehensive suite ensures robustness and functionality in diverse sorting scenarios.

## Features
- **Multi-Type Sorting**: Supports integers, characters, strings, and floating-point numbers.
- **Various Containers**: Tests bubble sort on vectors, C++ arrays, and built-in arrays.
- **Flexible Comparison**: Includes ascending, descending, and no-sort (control) tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Standard C++ libraries

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/versatile-bubble-sort.git

### Tests
**The test suite includes the following functions**:

- test1(): For int data type.
- test2(): For char data type.
- test3(): For string data type.
- test4(): For double data type.
- test5(): For long double data type.
- test6(): For float data type.
Each test function demonstrates sorting using lessThan, greaterThan, and doNothing comparison strategies.
